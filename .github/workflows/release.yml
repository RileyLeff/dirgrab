          ## Installation (Homebrew)

          To install `dirgrab` via Homebrew, you'll first need to create a Homebrew tap repository (if you haven't already).

          A common naming convention for a tap is `homebrew-<your-tap-name>`. Let's assume you name it `homebrew-dirgrab`.
          Create a new GitHub repository named `homebrew-dirgrab` under your account (`rileyleff/homebrew-dirgrab`).

          Inside this new tap repository, you'll need to create a Ruby file for the formula.
          The formula file should be placed in `Formula/dirgrab.rb`.

          You can use the `brew create` command to generate a starting point for your formula locally:

          ```bash
          brew create --url https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/${{ needs.create_source_archive.outputs.archive_name }} --sha256 ${{ needs.create_source_archive.outputs.sha256_hash }} dirgrab
          ```

          Edit the generated `dirgrab.rb` file to configure the build and installation steps. For a Rust project building from source:

          ```ruby
          class Dirgrab < Formula
            desc "CLI tool to concatenate file contents from directories"
            homepage "https://github.com/rileyleff/dirgrab" # Your project homepage
            url "https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/${{ needs.create_source_archive.outputs.archive_name }}"
            sha256 "${{ needs.create_source_archive.outputs.sha256_hash }}"
            license "MIT OR Apache-2.0" # Ensure this matches your LICENSE files
            head "https://github.com/rileyleff/dirgrab.git", branch: "main" # Update branch if needed

            depends_on "rust" => :build # Build dependency for Rust projects

            def install
              # Instructions on how to install after downloading and extracting the source archive
              # This example uses cargo install --path . to build from the extracted source
              system "cargo", "install", "--path", ".", "--root", prefix, "--bin", "dirgrab"
            end

            test do
              # Test the installed binary
              # Replace with a simple test for your CLI tool
              assert_match "dirgrab version", shell_output("#{bin}/dirgrab --version")
            end
          end
          ```

          After creating/updating the `Formula/dirgrab.rb` file in your tap repository, commit and push the changes.

          Users can then install your tool:

          ```bash
          brew tap rileyleff/dirgrab # Replace with your username and tap name
          brew install dirgrab
          ```

          **Binary Assets (Bottles):**
          The following pre-built binaries are attached to this release:

        draft: false # Set to true if you want to manually publish the release later
        prerelease: ${{ contains(github.ref_name, '-') }} # Automatically mark as prerelease for tags like v1.0.0-rc1
        # Upload all files found in the 'artifacts' directory (recursively) as release assets
        files: artifacts/**/*
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically available
